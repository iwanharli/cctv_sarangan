Project Overview
CCTV Streaming with Laravel and JavaScript
This project is a sophisticated web application designed to stream CCTV footage and display it in the U3U8 format. Built with Laravel and a JavaScript engine, the system provides a robust solution for handling and presenting real-time video streams from RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) sources.

Features
RTSP to U3U8 Conversion: The application efficiently converts RTSP streams to U3U8 format, enabling smooth playback in web browsers. This conversion ensures compatibility with various video players and enhances streaming performance.

Laravel Backend: The backend of the application is developed using Laravel, a powerful PHP framework. Laravel's elegant syntax and robust features are utilized to handle stream processing, manage user authentication, and provide a secure environment for video streaming.

JavaScript Engine: The frontend leverages a JavaScript engine to handle video playback. This engine interacts with the Laravel backend to fetch and display the video streams in real time. It ensures a seamless user experience with minimal latency.

User Authentication: The application includes secure user authentication, allowing only authorized users to access the CCTV streams. This feature is crucial for maintaining the privacy and security of the video content.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experiences across different devices and screen sizes.

Error Handling and Notifications: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are in place to manage potential issues during video streaming. Users are notified of any disruptions or errors, ensuring a reliable streaming experience.
